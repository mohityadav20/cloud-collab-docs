# Post-Deployment Guide

## ✅ What You've Done

- ✅ Added environment variables to AWS Amplify Console
- ✅ Triggered manual redeployment from Amplify Console

## 🔍 Monitor Your Deployment

### In AWS Amplify Console:

1. **Go to your app:**
   - Navigate to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/
   - Click on your app: **cloud-collab-docs**

2. **Check Deployment Status:**
   - Click on **"Deployments"** tab
   - You should see a new deployment building
   - Watch the progress:
     - **Building** → Installing dependencies
     - **Building** → Running build command
     - **Building** → Deploying files
     - **Deployed** ✅ (success!)

3. **Build should succeed now because:**
   - ✅ Environment variables are set
   - ✅ TypeScript errors are fixed
   - ✅ Code is ready

## 📍 Get Your App URL

After deployment completes:

1. **In Amplify Console:**
   - You'll see your app URL at the top
   - Format: `https://main.xxxxx.amplifyapp.com`
   - Or: `https://xxxxx.amplifyapp.com`

2. **Copy the URL** and open it in your browser

## 🧪 Test Your App

### Step 1: Sign Up
1. Open your app URL
2. Click **"Create account"**
3. Enter your email
4. Create a password
5. Check your email inbox
6. Click verification link
7. Return to app and sign in

### Step 2: Test Document Creation
1. After signing in, you should see document list
2. Click **"+ New Document"**
3. Give it a title
4. Start typing - changes auto-save!
5. Check that it saves without errors

### Step 3: Test Sharing (Optional)
1. Click **"Share"** button on a document
2. Enter another email
3. Choose permission (Read/Write)
4. Click **"Share"**

## ✅ Success Indicators

**If everything works:**
- ✅ Sign up/in works (no auth errors)
- ✅ Can create documents
- ✅ Can edit documents
- ✅ Changes save automatically
- ✅ Documents appear in list
- ✅ No console errors in browser

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Auth UserPool not configured"
**Solution:**
- Double-check environment variables in Amplify Console
- Verify values are correct (no typos)
- Make sure variables start with `VITE_`
- Redeploy again

### "Build failed"
**Solution:**
- Check build logs in Amplify Console
- Look for specific errors
- Verify environment variables are set
- Check if deployment completed

### "App loads but shows errors"
**Solution:**
- Open browser console (F12)
- Check for specific error messages
- Verify all environment variables are correct
- Check network tab for API calls

### "Documents not loading"
**Solution:**
- Check if API endpoint is correct
- Verify Cognito authentication is working
- Check browser console for GraphQL errors
- Verify DynamoDB tables were created

## 📊 What to Expect

### Deployment Time:
- **5-10 minutes** for first deployment with variables
- Subsequent deployments are faster

### First Load:
- App should load in 2-3 seconds
- Sign up/in should work immediately
- Document creation should work

### Performance:
- Real-time updates may take a moment to sync
- Auto-save happens after 1 second of inactivity
- Changes appear immediately in the editor

## 🎉 You're Done!

Once deployment completes and you can sign in:
- ✅ Your app is live!
- ✅ Backend is connected
- ✅ All services are working
- ✅ Ready for users!

**Congratulations on deploying your Cloud Collaborative Document Management System!** 🚀
