3. Check **"Deployments"** tab
4. Watch the latest deployment build
5. Wait for it to complete (should show "Deployed")

## ✅ Verify Everything Works

### After Deployment Completes:

1. **Check if deployment succeeded:**
   - Should show "Deployed" status
   - No errors in build logs

2. **Open your app URL:**
   - Should load without errors
   - Should show sign-in page

3. **Test authentication:**
   - Sign up works
   - Sign in works
   - No "Auth UserPool not configured" errors

4. **Test document creation:**
